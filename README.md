# Archive of problem solutions

This repository contains various **competitive programming** problems I have solved so far.
There are problems from various platforms: LeetCode, Codeforces and ... (I will be extending this list).


The problems are soved mainly in C++ and JavaScript. I usually try to reimplement the solutions when I am learning a new language. That's why there might appear more languages.

I group the problems from Codeforces by their difficuly (A,B,C,...).
I don't group LeetCode problems as I choose them randomly in the platform.
